## What is this project?
This is a Task Management System backend built with **Laravel 11** and **MariaDB/MySQL**. The project was developed as a test assessment for **Digitised**.

## How does this project setup work?
Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

### 1. Clone the repository
Clone the repository using the following command:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

### 2. Create a `.env` file
Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided in the root directory.

### 3. Install dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash

### 4. Run migrations with seeders
Run the following command to migrate the database and seed it with initial data:
```bash

```

**Important Note:** When running migrations, make sure to include the `--seed` flag, as it contains seeded users with the following credentials:
* **Email:** user@digitised.com
* **Password:** 123456789

The seeded user comes with **10 pre-populated tasks** to make testing easier. Alternatively, you can register a new user through the provided API endpoints.
